# ThisTrip web interface

## Getting Started

Install packages with `yarn`, and start the server with `yarn start`.

## Technologies and Tools Used
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which provided a solid foundation of bundler configuration and other environmental support, nicely encapsulated in the `react-scripts` package. I quickly removed the generated code, save for `index.js`, which handles the app's initial mounting and rendering.
